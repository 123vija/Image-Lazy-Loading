            <p>The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an Historically, detecting visibility of an element, or the relative visibility of two elements in relation to each other, has been a difficult task for which solutions have been unreliable and prone to causing the browser and the sites the user is accessing to become sluggish. As the web has matured, the need for this kind of information has grown. Intersection information is needed for many reasons, such as:ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport.</p>

            <p>Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is scrolled.</p>
            <p>Implementing "infinite scrolling" websites, where more and more content is loaded and rendered as you scroll, so that the user doesn't have to flip through pages.</p>
            <p>Reporting of visibility of advertisements in order to calculate ad revenues.</p>
            <p>Deciding whether or not to perform tasks or animation processes based on whether or not the user will see the result.</p>
            <p>The first time the observer is initially asked to watch a target element.</p>
            <p>A target element intersects either the device's viewport or a specified element. That specified element is called the root element or root for the purposes of the Intersection Observer API.</p>
